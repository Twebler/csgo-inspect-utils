# csgo-inspect-utils

Just a small programming iam writing to learn about json and apis.

it has multiple funtions such as getting information about a item based of a csgo inspect link
or generating a gen code from such a link which can be used in inspect servers.
and also a few other funcs.

plans:
making a tool like this one https://andersonproescholdbell.github.io/floatsV1/index.html to learn more about how to handle large sets of data
and just generally making a custom float tool

side note:
invetory.json is just a prototyping file so i dont have request the steam api all the time which is heavily rate limited
